////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

This asset contains Gimp files (I cannot provide PSD) to make
reskinning of this asset possible. To access the source files
rename emd_sw8_source.tga to emd_sw8_source.zip and open the
archive. If you cannot see the extention of the file in
windows explorer, go to Tools -> Folder Options -> View (tab)
and uncheck "Hide extensions for known file types".


The "a_parts" file contains all the reskinnable parts of the 
locomotive. The "b_parts" file contains transparent and cab
textures. An example paint scheme titled for "Pine Lake Timber Company"
is provided as a reference to make it easier to line up pin-striping between 
the hood faces.


 Also, the original .blend file is also included to make
 it possible to modify the locomotive for custom use. MAX 
 files cannot and will not be provided. the "lod0" LOD level 
 includes the locomotive and railing details (layers 1 and 2
 in Blender). "lod1" LOD level only contains the basic body
  elements (only layer 1 in Blender). This model has an export
  scale factor of 1.78 in the Blender -> Trainz Exporter.

  
  It is suggested that before uploading any modifications 
  that the included source files be removed to save on 
  file size.

 Any use of this content with the intention of making a profit
 is strictly prohibited. Reskinning and modification is encouraged.
 Credit is appreciated but not required.
